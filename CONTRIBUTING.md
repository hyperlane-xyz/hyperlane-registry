# Contributing

This registry is maintained by the core Hyperlane team, but community members are encouraged to add chain and deployment information here!

## Benefits

By adding chain metadata, deployment addresses, and other information here, you make it easier to use with Hyperlane tooling, such as the [Explorer](https://explorer.hyperlane.xyz) and the [CLI](https://docs.hyperlane.xyz/docs/reference/cli). For example, users will be able to search for messages to chains using [Permissionless Interoperability](https://docs.hyperlane.xyz/docs/reference/glossary#permissionless-interoperability) without having to specify the metadata themselves.

## Process

1. Fork and clone the registry repository
2. Use the CLI and set the `--registry` flag to the local path of the cloned repository
3. Execute your commands as needed, such as `hyperlane deploy core --registry <YOUR_URI>`
4. Push your changes to your fork and create a pull request

Once you've opened a PR, the Hyperlane team will review it. If it meets the requirements, it will be merged into the registry.
