# Hyperlane Registry

A collection of configs, artifacts, and schemas for Hyperlane. See the [documentation](https://docs.hyperlane.xyz/docs/reference/registries) for more information.

## Contents

### Chains

A list of chains and the relevant information that Hyperlane utilities and apps will require to interact with chains.
Structured as a folder for each chain. Each folder should contain a `metadata.yaml`, `addresses.yaml`, and a `logo.svg` file.

### Deployments

#### Core

Configs and artifacts for [Hyperlane Core Contract](https://docs.hyperlane.xyz/docs/deploy/deploy-hyperlane) deployments.

#### Warp

Address artifacts for [Warp Route](https://docs.hyperlane.xyz/docs/deploy/deploy-warp-route) token deployments.

## Contributing

This registry is maintained by the core Hyperlane team but community members are encouraged to add chain and deployment information here! See the [Contribution Guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.
