# Hyperlane AVS

This directory contains the core AVS deployment addresses like the `HyperlaneServiceManager` and the `ECDSAStakeRegistry`. In the future, it'll also house the different `IRemoteChallenger` configuration which will be used to verify the remote fraud attestation from different Hyperlane applications.
